# PyCounter-Conversion
COUNTER-4 report short-form conversion to Pandas dataframes

The PyCounter_converter library is for extending the functionality of the PyCounter library, on which this project is based. It's the V1 of this project, which eventually branched off from PyCounter to become an independent library inspired by PyCounter.


Pybr.py is the working version of the library used at UNT for extracting XML-formatted COUNTER reports from our e-resource providers, reconfiguring them as Pandas dataframes, and formatting them for injection into a (SQL or NoSQL) database.

COUNTER-5 support is on the horizon, as soon as we have a few COUNTER-5-compliant platforms to test on.
